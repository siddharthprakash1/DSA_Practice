Sure, let's visualize the sorting process step-by-step using a concrete example. We'll use the pseudocode and illustrate each step with a sample input stack.

Initial Input Stack
Let's start with an input stack: [34, 3, 31, 98, 92, 23] (top is 23)

Pseudocode
vbnet
Copy code
Create an empty stack called additionalStack

While inputStack is not empty:
    Store the top element of inputStack in a temporary variable and pop it
    While additionalStack is not empty and its top element is greater than the temporary value:
        Move the top element of additionalStack back to inputStack
    Push the temporary value onto additionalStack

While additionalStack is not empty:
    Move the top element of additionalStack back to inputStack

At this point, inputStack is sorted in ascending order
Step-by-Step Visualization
Initial State:

inputStack: [34, 3, 31, 98, 92, 23]
additionalStack: []
First Iteration:

Pop 23 from inputStack.
additionalStack is empty, so push 23 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [34, 3, 31, 98, 92]
additionalStack: [23]
Second Iteration:

Pop 92 from inputStack.
additionalStack's top (23) is not greater than 92, so push 92 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [34, 3, 31, 98]
additionalStack: [23, 92]
Third Iteration:

Pop 98 from inputStack.
additionalStack's top (92) is not greater than 98, so push 98 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [34, 3, 31]
additionalStack: [23, 92, 98]
Fourth Iteration:

Pop 31 from inputStack.
additionalStack's top (98) is greater than 31, so move 98 back to inputStack.
additionalStack's top (92) is greater than 31, so move 92 back to inputStack.
additionalStack's top (23) is not greater than 31, so push 31 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [34, 3, 98, 92]
additionalStack: [23, 31]
Fifth Iteration:

Pop 92 from inputStack.
additionalStack's top (31) is not greater than 92, so push 92 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [34, 3, 98]
additionalStack: [23, 31, 92]
Sixth Iteration:

Pop 98 from inputStack.
additionalStack's top (92) is not greater than 98, so push 98 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [34, 3]
additionalStack: [23, 31, 92, 98]
Seventh Iteration:

Pop 3 from inputStack.
additionalStack's top (98) is greater than 3, so move 98 back to inputStack.
additionalStack's top (92) is greater than 3, so move 92 back to inputStack.
additionalStack's top (31) is greater than 3, so move 31 back to inputStack.
additionalStack's top (23) is greater than 3, so move 23 back to inputStack.
additionalStack is empty, so push 3 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [34, 98, 92, 31, 23]
additionalStack: [3]
Eighth Iteration:

Pop 23 from inputStack.
additionalStack's top (3) is not greater than 23, so push 23 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [34, 98, 92, 31]
additionalStack: [3, 23]
Ninth Iteration:

Pop 31 from inputStack.
additionalStack's top (23) is not greater than 31, so push 31 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [34, 98, 92]
additionalStack: [3, 23, 31]
Tenth Iteration:

Pop 92 from inputStack.
additionalStack's top (31) is not greater than 92, so push 92 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [34, 98]
additionalStack: [3, 23, 31, 92]
Eleventh Iteration:

Pop 98 from inputStack.
additionalStack's top (92) is not greater than 98, so push 98 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [34]
additionalStack: [3, 23, 31, 92, 98]
Twelfth Iteration:

Pop 34 from inputStack.
additionalStack's top (98) is greater than 34, so move 98 back to inputStack.
additionalStack's top (92) is greater than 34, so move 92 back to inputStack.
additionalStack's top (31) is not greater than 34, so push 34 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [98, 92]
additionalStack: [3, 23, 31, 34]
Final Moves:

Move 98 and 92 back to additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: []
additionalStack: [3, 23, 31, 34, 92, 98]
Move from additionalStack to inputStack:

Move all elements back to inputStack.
State:
inputStack: [98, 92, 34, 31, 23, 3]
additionalStack: []
Final Sorted Stack
The input stack is now sorted in ascending order (from bottom to top): [3, 23, 31, 34, 92, 98].

This step-by-step visualization helps understand how the sorting algorithm works using an additional stack.

Let's clarify steps 14 and 15 in more detail, ensuring you understand how the elements are moved between the stacks.

State After Step 13:
After popping and sorting elements until the input stack is empty, we have:

inputStack: [98, 92]
additionalStack: [3, 23, 31, 34]
Step 14: Moving Remaining Elements to additionalStack
We continue processing the remaining elements in the input stack, ensuring they are placed correctly in the additional stack.

Pop 92 from inputStack:

additionalStack's top (34) is not greater than 92, so push 92 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: [98]
additionalStack: [3, 23, 31, 34, 92]
Pop 98 from inputStack:

additionalStack's top (92) is not greater than 98, so push 98 onto additionalStack.
State:
inputStack: []
additionalStack: [3, 23, 31, 34, 92, 98]
At this point, the inputStack is empty and additionalStack contains all elements in ascending order (from bottom to top).

Step 15: Moving Elements Back to inputStack
Finally, we need to move all elements from additionalStack back to inputStack so that the inputStack is sorted in ascending order.

Pop 98 from additionalStack and push onto inputStack:

State:
inputStack: [98]
additionalStack: [3, 23, 31, 34, 92]
Pop 92 from additionalStack and push onto inputStack:

State:
inputStack: [98, 92]
additionalStack: [3, 23, 31, 34]
Pop 34 from additionalStack and push onto inputStack:

State:
inputStack: [98, 92, 34]
additionalStack: [3, 23, 31]
Pop 31 from additionalStack and push onto inputStack:

State:
inputStack: [98, 92, 34, 31]
additionalStack: [3, 23]
Pop 23 from additionalStack and push onto inputStack:

State:
inputStack: [98, 92, 34, 31, 23]
additionalStack: [3]
Pop 3 from additionalStack and push onto inputStack:

State:
inputStack: [98, 92, 34, 31, 23, 3]
additionalStack: []
Final State:
inputStack: [98, 92, 34, 31, 23, 3] (top to bottom: 3, 23, 31, 34, 92, 98)
additionalStack: []
The inputStack is now sorted in ascending order (from bottom to top).

Summary of Steps:
Move elements from inputStack to additionalStack while maintaining sorted order in additionalStack.
Move all elements back from additionalStack to inputStack to restore the original stack with elements sorted.
This ensures that the original stack is sorted in ascending order using the additional stack for intermediate storage.
